# Hiromaji
A Web App for learning Japanese Hiragana and Katakana characters   
WDP3 Web project by Bavly Abousif and Marcel Salvenmoser

## Features
### Hiragana and Katakana tables
You can chose, what you want to learn on the selection page. You can pick out a row, multiple rows or the whole table. Your selection is automatically saved in the browsers localstorage. After you decide to change your selection, your previous choice will still be present on the selection page. 

### Kana to Romaji
On here you are presented a Kana character and you have to type in the Romaji equivalent. To continue, you must type in the correct characters. There is also a help button if you get stuck, but if you chose to use it the character will be marked as wrong on the history board.

### Romaji to Kana
This mode shows you a Romaji representation of a Kana character. There are 4 Buttons and only 1 has the correct answer. You can also play with your keyboard using "1-4" to select button 1-4. 

You can always go back and change your character selection and it will be updated on the next page refresh.
